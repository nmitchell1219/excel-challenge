Completed Excel challenge for module 1
Statistical Analysis: I believe that using the median better summarizes the data because there are very large variances within both successful and failed campaigns. There is more variability with successful campaigns. This makes sense because looking at the data, the total campaign and backer count is much higher, there is a larger gap between minimum and maximum backer count, and the standard deviation is higher.
